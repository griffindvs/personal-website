Hi, I'm Griffin. This is my website.

<br></br>
I'm a software engineer at [IBM](https://ibm.com) bringing cloud-native
applications to enterprises. I currently work on deployment and lifecycle
management of [IBM Cloud Pak for
AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-aiops) and the data systems
powering it.

I previously studied computer science at [UT
Dallas](https://utdallas.edu) where I created [tools for
students](https://utdal.github.io/sg-budget-breakdown/) and built [machine
learning models to study economic
mobility](https://hdl.handle.net/10735.1/9926).

export default ({ children }) => (

    <PageLayout title={title}>{children}</PageLayout>
  </CoreLayout>
